is it efficient: 
	its probably a narrow approach, but for kids and different fields

opinion on tech for daily tasks:
	its completely indespensable. there is no way to avoid it. it 
	csimplifies the communication, the access, the sharing, the writing.
	the interaction, the production, etc.
	for books, and for extensible works, the user prevers the analogic 
	version, since the screen doesnt provide the same levels of 
	concentrations and the deeper thoughs about.
	but for anything else the navigation using html gives allows users
	to even discover completely new things they wouldnt in different 
	more traditional methods.
opnion on tech for learning tasks:
	it provides autonomia and independence and cross and enrich
	any analysis and research.
opnion changed before:
	it changed, now the user accepts that the use of technology is
	imprescindivel, since the web and modern operating systems more 
	(user friendly), it became much more accessible and completely
	essential for daily tasks (bank transfers, etc)







analysis on user:
	the creation of questions and answers was a very effective challenge
	that helped the user studying, maybe even more than the reviewing 
	section.
