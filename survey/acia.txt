"" for learning tasks: 
    of course its very reachable and practical, but you end up being overwhelmed
    with the options and don't where to start. if you have a working model it would be efficient
    but you're worried that the more different methods exists the harder it is
    to stick with something and the learning becomes even more difficult.
    You end up loosing the interest you had to practice in the first place.
    But you are opened to change your opinion.
opnion changed before: 
    you used to think it was amazing but changed your mind.
    the more you use it, the slower your brain becomes, because you rely 
    too much on the practicality of technology and loose the ability to memorize.
    Example, you have a dictionary and its easier to just check everytime for 
    and answer than actually learning it.
    The thought process became slower.
