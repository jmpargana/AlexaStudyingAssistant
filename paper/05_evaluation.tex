\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{cha:evaluation}

Even though this project was mainly thought of as a development thesis,
the potential for interesting conclusions that 
could be drawn from this experiment was so high that it was decided 
to do some research with the resulting project as well.

This chapter of my thesis presents the whole evaluation of the 
developed tool. It also serves as proof of my exposed theory in 
the abstract section, that technology can be easily adopted by 
a general public to assist and facilitate learning habits.

The chapter is organized as follow: I'll start by describing 
the methodology used to evaluate the skill, explaining how 
it profiles the users and their behaviors. I will follow 
the aforementioned by the statistical data provided 
by the experiment, showing the scope of the users' 
characteristics and how they represent certain classes. 
I'll then finish the chapter with the valuable results 
and suggestions received with feedback in addition to 
my academical interpretation of the accomplished.


\section{Methodology}

The methodology behind the survey is heavily inspired by the TAM 
(Technology Acceptance Model). The features it tries to outline, 
are the user's perceived usefulness and ease-of-use. 
In addition to these attributes, my survey has a heavy focal 
point on defining the user's profile, or establishing a 
classification class or target group which shares the stipulated 
characteristics of the aforementioned profile. The latter's 
objective is to draw supplementary conclusions, such as to 
discover whether or not a certain group is more prone to a 
wide adoption of the/a new technology and is ready to promptly 
change its learning customs.
Furthermore, the survey inquires its user about suggestions 
on improvements or other features that could make the 
software more appealing to the target class and a more 
global scope of attainable users.
For logistical reasons, mostly the incapacitating restrictions 
originated by the COVID-19 virus, 
this survey and experiment was only performed on 
a sorted out set of 5 individuals, 
all representing different classification classes, namely different 
age groups, professional backgrounds and studying purposes 
(academic, professional or recreational).
As such, the extent of the survey its 
much larger than the commonly used TAM studies, 
for it contains much more extensive and 
particular questions, in order to derive prevailing 
and accurate deductions.


\section{Survey Candidates Sampling}

For logistical reasons, mainly the impacts of COVID-19 in university 
infrastructures, the survey and experiment was performed on a much 
smaller subset of users, than that 
expected by the regular Technology Acceptance Model surveys. 
Instead of testing the software with 100+ users, it was only 
optional to narrow down and assembly a total of
6 test subjects. For that reason, a compromise was found 
and before sampling the subjects
a graph was created to represent the main classes and targets 
of the potential audience of this application.

SHOW IMAGE HERE.

The most important distinctions, which represent fundamental 
differences between users
were found in 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Age: } Perhaps the most important from all the 
	parameters categorized
        in the sampling process, age has an almost direct influence 
	on all the other criteria. If the test subject is in its 
	twenties, then he will more likely 
        be using the software to practice for school or some 
	certification needed. The subject will also more likely be 
	more knowledgeable of newer technologies. If
        the subject in over its seventies, he will very 
	unlikely be working for
        professional purposes, etc. 
	This class will be divided in five main age groups that share 
	learning purposes and habits: 6-18 as a pupil, who will most likely
	be studying either for school or a certification. 19-28 as a student
	or junior starting his career mostly gathering certification, academical
	degrees or learning for some hobby interest. 29-50 as a professional
	that either learns for his professional career or out of interest.
	51-65 as a senior worker that will either need to learn some new skill
	for his work or for a hobby. 66+ as a retired individual who will 
	most likely only learn and practice something out of interest with
	absolutely no professional goals in mind.

    \item \textbf{Purpose/Goal: } This was indeed a very important 
	distinction in the sampling process. This parameter 
	was divided in three categories.
	Professional/career, academical/school/certification or 
	hobby/recreational. Even though the attitude towards learning
	can be the same or different across these different categories,
	for example, a student might be equally inspired learning 
	for an university topic as he is for something he might be
	learning for entertainment purposes only, the type of
	motivation in the background is very different. 
	Someone studying for professional reasons, being motivated or
	not, is to expect similar consequences regarding their work.
	Either to get a promotion, or to improve the workflow, but the type
	of expectations, clearly affects the drive that guides the learning 
	process.
	

    \item \textbf{Professional/Academic Background: }
	Also an important mean of measurement is the academical background 
	of the interviewee. If the user has a extensive educational context,
	he is expected to have gathered a framework of methods to assists in
	his learning habits, while someone without it will more likely resort
	to different tools.
	This field could be separated with four main categories, namely:
	high school or equivalency diplomas (pupils would be automatically
	included in this field), professional degree or academic degree, where
	the later will create distinctions for minor/major and PHD.

    \item \textbf{Practicing Habits: }
	Although this point is heavily influenced by the others, as are all 
	the five by each other, the habits a learner has to enhance his 
	knowledge of the given topic is very important regarding his approach
	to A: sensibility to change and B: perspective on use of technology.
	This class will be split into people that study less than 1 hour a week,
	from 1 to 3 hours a week or more than 3 hours a week.

    \item \textbf{Attitude Towards Technology: }
	Perhaps the most important factor, although already mentioned and 
	deliberately influenced by the practicing habits, the attitude towards
	technology plays an essential role in the users apprehension of the
	system and potential change of behaviour as explained by the 
	TAM **creators** (REFERENCE).  
	This field will be dissected into three groups, someone with negative 
	view on technology, that for instance actively tries to avoid usage 
	of technology as much as possible, someone with neutral view, that ends
	up using technology very widely, but is not particularly kin on it, and
	someone that has a very positive view, a person that will be a typically
	early adopter of new technologies.

\end{itemize}


A major field used to categorize and distinguish users in a survey is gender.
I made a conscience choice to avoid this differentiation, as although it might
regularly show interesting dissimilarities, a sample of 6 test subjects is much
too small, and any differences will likely be biased by the other parameters 
mentioned above, which in my opinion play a much bigger role in the learning 
habits and practices of learners.


As one might observe from the diagram shown in **UML-GRAPH**, the combination of
all different evaluation parameters with their given subclasses means at least
540 test subjects would need to be survey, which would be impossible given the
conditions mentioned in the beginning of the chapter. For that reason, the users
chosen to represent the classes are the 6 most distant points in the 5 
dimensional space of these characteristics.

As such, the first selected 6 test subjects were: 

\subsection{Toddler}
The first test subject was a nine year old toddler, who is learning English to
improve his grades at school. Is profile can be shown in the following table:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | }

\subsection{Senior Office Worker}
The fifth test subject was a sixty two year old office worker who wants 
to practice knowledge needed at work, as the leader of the library department
of the Portuguese Ministry of Education, 
and was opened to try a new 
methodology, even though she had 
a negative view on technology. The table shows other parameters:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | }
	\hline

		Attitude Towards Technology & Negative \\
	\hline

	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Pensioner}
The last test subject was a seventy two year old pensioner who is very kin on
the use of technology and an early adopter and used it to practice his 
studying of the Chinese culture. The profile is shown below:


\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | }
	\hline
		Age & 66+ \\
	\hline

	\hline
		Attitude Towards Technology & Positive \\
	\hline

	\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\section{Interview Process}

**DESCRIPTION**

 
\section{Survey}

As mentioned above the survey was adapted from generalized 
TAM questions, which are used on experiments with 100+ users, to a more detailed
set of questions which focus mainly on three big aspects. The learner's 
attitude towards technology, the ease-of-use and the perceived usefulness of
the developed system.

There is a short profile section that inquires the user about the list of 
parameters mentioned earlier in this chapter, followed by a pre-questionnaire
to be inquired before the use of the application 
and a post-questionnaire. Besides asking more extensive questions about the
overall experience, the survey also urges to learner for suggestions that could
improve the efficiency of the still young and incomplete software.

The following can be observed here:

**REFERENCE TO SURVEY**

The results are going to be divided into each one of the participants, since 
they yield very different conclusions.



\subsection{Toddler}
The six year old toddler that used the smart speaker application to improve
his English as a foreign language skills, showed very positive results. He
already had a very positive view on technologies and had a tablet as mentioned
by his primary teacher to assist on some homework.

\subsection{University Student}

\subsection{Junior Getting Certification}

\subsection{Professional Learning For Hobby}

\subsection{Senior Office Worker}

\subsection{Pensioner}
